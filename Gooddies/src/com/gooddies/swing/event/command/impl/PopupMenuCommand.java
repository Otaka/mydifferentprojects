/**
 * Concrete Command object implements PopupMenuListener and its events.
 * This class has a Receiver object and invokes the invokeMethodFromController

 *
 * PopupMenuCommand applies for JPopupMenu and JComboBox objects.
 * 
 * PopupMenuCommand is fired when JPopupMenu or JComboBox will become visible,
 * invisible, or canceled without a selection.
 *
 * PopupMenuEvent does not inherit from ComponentEvent (as many Swing
 * components), it inherits directly from ObjectEvent and does not include the
 * getID() method to identify related events.
