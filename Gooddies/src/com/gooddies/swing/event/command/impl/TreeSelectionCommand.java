 * Concrete Command object implements TreeSelectionListener and its events.

 * method of the receiver.

 * TreeSelectionCommand applies just for JTree objects.
 * 
 * TreeSelectionCommand is fired when the selection is changed in a
 * TreeSelectionModel.
 * 
 * TreeSelectionEvent does not inherit from ComponentEvent (as many Swing
 * components), it inherits directly from ObjectEvent and does not include the
 * getID() method to identify related events.
