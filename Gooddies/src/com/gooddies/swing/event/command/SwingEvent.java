/**
 * SwingEvent annotation applies a Command Design Pattern partially that
 * simplifies the using and the implemention of Listeners for Swing Components.
 * SwingEvent, in contrast to EventBus and other projects, adds listeners to
 * Swing Components dynamically with Annotations located in each Method.
 * Annotation includes sources, command and eventIds params that are related
 * with one o several Swing Components.<br>
 * SwingEvent supports multiple components and methods relationship.
 * @param sources List of Swing Components
 *     (e.g. {@code sources={"exitMenuItem","exitPopupMenuItem"}})
 * @param command Concrete Command class type
 *     (e.g. {@code command=ActionCommand.class})
 * @param eventIds List of events to be called by the Listener. Default value is
 *     "0" for Listeners with just one event implemented. For several methods,
 *     the event Ids should be included.
 *     (e.g. {@code eventIds={MouseEvent.MOUSE_PRESSED,MouseEvent.MOUSE_RELEASED}
 *     for a command=MouseCommand.class)
 * 
 * @see <a href="http://www.eventbus.org/index.html">EventBus Project</a>
